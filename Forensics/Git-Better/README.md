# Git Better (Forensics)

## Description (problem statement)

After you found my secrets I learned how to edit my commits so that you can never find them again!!!

## Summary (solution)

Similar to Git Gud, but instead of just going to the commit, this one is amended so you have to use `git reflog` or `git log -g` (or something similar).
