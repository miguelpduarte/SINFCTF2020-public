# Split! (Forensics)

## Description (problem statement)

We were taking this file up to the forensics lab. However, as we were carrying it, it fell and split into pieces! Can you help us recover it??

**NOTE:** The indices on the files have no specific meaning. They just differentiate each file from one another.

## Summary (solution)

Reorder the file parts until it makes sense. Then it's a zip file, unzip and get the flag.txt inside!
