# Quantum Remapping code (Misc)

## Description (problem statement)

I think that a mad scientist created this program! They called it a Quantum Randomizer, then a Quantum Remapper, then a Quantum Refobbler.

The output seems weird but I think that there is something hiding behind it! Can you find the secret?

## Summary (solution)

The program output will be `xcoordinate + ycoordinate = ?` and the answer will always be either 1 or 0, to which the program will answer `yes` or `no` depending on how you answered.

These are the coordinates to a QR code that you can create after getting the coords that has the flag.
