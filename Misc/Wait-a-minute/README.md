# Wait a minute (Web/Misc)

## Description (problem statement)

I've found this weird service that asks you for the flag instead of sending it... Can we find it out somehow?

## Summary (solution)

Timing attack, 500ms delay per correct character

**PS:** Yes I used Elixir for this one, I wanted to try it :P
