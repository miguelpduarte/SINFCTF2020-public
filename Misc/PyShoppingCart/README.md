# PyShoppingCart (Misc)

## Description (problem statement)

I've created a shopping cart manager app in Python! What do you think?

## Summary (solution)

Python format string vuln to leak global variables

Add an item with w/e for quantity and `{0.__init__.__globals__[flag]}` for the type, then list items.
