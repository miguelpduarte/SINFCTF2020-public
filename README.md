# SINFCTF2020-public
CTF Challenges (and official solutions) created for [SINFCTF2020](https://ctf.sinf.pt), a companion CTF for [Semana de Inform√°tica 2020](https://sinf.pt). This CTF was organized completely by myself, with some help for beta-testing the challenges before them going live. [Here's my blogpost about organizing the CTF](https://miguelpduarte.me/blog/sinfctf-2020).

There's a folder for each challenge category, and inside them a folder for each challenge with the challenge files and a README with the problem statement and expected solution.
For the challenges in which it is relevant, a `solution` folder is included with a sample solution that I developed myself when testing the CTF.

Everything is Dockerized, so if you want to run any challenge you can just use the provided `docker-compose.yml`.
