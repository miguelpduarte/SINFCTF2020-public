## Summary (solution)

Bacon cypher. Decoded message is `letthebaconsizzle` which we can then wrap in the flag format.

Via cyberchef:
`ABABB AABAA BAABB BAABB AABBB AABAA AAAAB AAAAA AAABA ABBBA ABBAB BAABA ABAAA BBAAB BBAAB ABABB AABAA`

Which then gives us the flag in all caps.

update: made the flag case insensitive just in case someone uses cyberchef and gets it in all caps
